- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
 Min-max normalization: Guarantees all features will have the exact same scale but does not handle outliers well
 Z-score normalization: Handles outliers, but does not produce normalized data with the exact same scale.
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
When you test using something like System.out, you're only testing a small subset of possible use-cases. This is not very thorough when you're dealing with systems that could accept a near infinite amount of different inputs.

Unit tests are designed to allow you to quickly run tests on your application using a very large and diverse set of different data inputs. Additionally, the best unit tests also account for boundary cases, such as the data inputs that lie right on the edge of what is considered valid.

For a human being to test all of these different inputs could take weeks whereas it could take minutes for a machine.

- What is the IDE did you use?
```
intelliJ
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
Core Java API
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
1. Wasn't exactly sure about how to implement the zScore and MinMax as I have only studied this only at the university before. So I had watch online tutorials before I start the implementation.
2. I didn't work with BigDecimal with all it's function before. So it was a bit challenging first to know how to do the rounding.
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
I ran out of the time, I decided to submit the question without the bonus. :( 
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes indeed, the tasks tests my technical skills in java when it comes to:
1. Core java API 
2. Java 8 
3. Unit Test cases
4. Design Patterns.
5. Clean code design.
6. Many other areas.
```
